**************************************************

This program uses a recursive function to read in from an input file,
store a line from an input file as raw data, process the data by getting
rid of all of the spaces and punctuation, and then stores the remaining
characters reversed in a new string. With the two new strings stored,
a comparison is made to check if the word is a palindrome. At the end of
the function a boolean expression is checked and output according to
whether the string is a a palindrome or not. Then the function checks
if the input file still has a data left to read, if so then the function
is called recursively, if not then the function ends.
