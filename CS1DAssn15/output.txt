*   ASSIGNMENT #15: Huffman Coding
******************************************************

The goal of this assignment is for the user to be able to store
an input file worth of text, compress it in to binary by using
the Huffman coding algorithm, and then be able to send it to
someone and allow them to decompress it.

Compressing File
The Decompressed File- 
Four score and seven years ago our fathers brought forth on this continent, a 
new nation, conceived in Liberty, and dedicated to the proposition that all men 
are created equal. Now we are engaged in a great civil war, testing whether that 
nation, or any nation so conceived and so dedicated, can long endure. We are met 
on a great battle-field of that war. We have come to dedicate a portion of that 
field, as a final resting place for those who here gave their lives that that 
nation might live. It is altogether fitting and proper that we should do this. 
But, in a larger sense, we can not dedicate -- we can not consecrate -- we can 
not hallow -- this ground. The brave men, living and dead, who struggled here, 
have consecrated it, far above our poor power to add or detract. The world will 
little note, nor long remember what we say here, but it can never forget what 
they did here. It is for us the living, rather, to be dedicated here to the 
unfinished work which they who fought here have thus far so nobly advanced. It 
is rather for us to be here dedicated to the great task remaining before us -- 
that from these honored dead we take increased devotion to that cause for which 
they gave the last full measure of devotion -- that we here highly resolve that 
these dead shall not have died in vain -- that this nation, under God, shall 
have a new birth of freedom -- and that government of the people, by the people, 
for the people, shall not perish from the earth.people, for the people, shall 
not perish from the earth.
