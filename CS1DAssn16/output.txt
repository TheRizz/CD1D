The goal of this program is to test three different string
searching algorithms. This progam tests: the brute force
algorithm, the Boyer-Moore algorithm, and the Knuth-Morris-
Pratt algorithm. All of these algorithms perform a certain
number of comparisons to match the pattern to the text. This
program outputs the number of comparisons required on all three.
