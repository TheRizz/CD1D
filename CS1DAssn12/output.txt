Assignment 12 Dijkstra and MST

***************************************************************
This program stores information in to a graph and then performs
a Dijkstra's traversal through the graph, outputting the
verticies on the shortest route as well as the total distance
at the end of the route. In addition to this, the program also
outputs the minimum spanning tree using Prim's algorithm to find
the mos efficient route. This outputs all of the edges in order
as well as the total mileage in the end.
