**************************************************
Part A of this program implements a queue interface
with a wrapper of a doubly linked list class. With
the wrapper, the code tests functions size, empty
front, enqueue, and dequeue. Part B implements a
vector ADT using a circularly extendible array. The
goal of this is to create a vector class, instead of
using the STL vector, and get the class to properly
allocate memory when necessary.
**************************************************

Part 1:
This is a test of the queue wrapper

The queue contains 0 items
The queue is empty
A man, a plan, a canal, Panama has been added to the queue
The queue contains 1 items
The queue is not empty
A man, a plan, a canal, Panama is at the front of the queue
Was it a car or a cat I saw? has been added to the queue
The queue contains 2 items
Sit on a potato pan, Otis has been added to the queue
No lemon, no melon has been added to the queue
The queue contains 4 items
A man, a plan, a canal, Panama has been removed from the queue
Was it a car or a cat I saw? is at the front of the queue
Was it a car or a cat I saw? has been removed from the queue
Sit on a potato pan, Otis has been removed from the queue
No lemon, no melon is at the front of the queue
The queue contains 1 items
No lemon, no melon has been removed from the queue
The V contains 0 items
The queue is empty

Part 2:
This is a test of a Vector ADT

The Vector contains 0 items
This Vector's capacity is 0
The Vector is empty
No lemon, no melon has been added to the Vector
This Vector's capacity is 1
A man, a plan, a canal, Panama has been added to the Vector
Sit on a potato pan, Otis has been added to the Vector
Was it a car or a cat I saw? has been added to the Vector
This Vector's capacity is 4
The Vector contains 4 items
The Vector is not empty
No lemon, no melon is at the front of the Vector
A man, a plan, a canal, Panama is at the second item of the Vector
A man, a plan, a canal, Panama has been removed from the queue
The Vector contains 3 items
The Vector holds Sit on a potato pan, Otis in the second item stored in the
vector
